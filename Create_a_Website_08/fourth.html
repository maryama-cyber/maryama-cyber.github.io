        <p>“It doesn't get better, the darkness, until you invite someone else to help you shine a light at your shadows, hidden demons, and deep secrets.”<br>
            <br>
            That someone for me was my incredible husband. He is my rock. My best friend. My everything. Us against all evil. He forced himself into my life and I have not regretted letting him in. Sure there has been bad times and some very bad times. We are not perfect. But we have survived. He took my darkness and helped me turn it into some kind of a shadow, not pure light but better. It was hard for me to let someone so close, let my walls down and invite him to see my worst. But he also got my best.<br>
            <br>
            To make things easier, he was also easy on the eye. The positive side when you marry a fashion model. It didn’t go worse when he decided to pursue the path of a bodybuilder. Who would complain of having a fit man around the house? And the more positive side even was that no matter what, I would always look small next him! Him being 190cm tall and me at my 165 I could wear as high heels as I possibly could and still be short. After all the “not so good things” that had happened in my life, I finally found my destiny. Or to be exact, my destiny found me. And it has gotten better. We will continue shining at each other’s shadows.<br>
            <br>
            Now we have lived apart for 2 years. We have met frequently, but not every month. It makes marriage life a bit challenging to say the least. I am excited to see how we are after these years. For sure we have both changed. We will live in a new environment, again. In a new country for me. The good part of living in Saudi is that I have already gotten used to the “Arab way” of dealing with everything. I don’t like it, but it will not be such a shock now. I already know that things will happen when they will happen; if they will happen. No need to expect schedules to be binding. No need to be stressing over it. InshaAllah yaany.<br>

            1 and half weeks left. 4 day shifts. I just got my passport and exit –visa out from the Government Relations office yesterday. Just my final payment left to be paid.<br>
            <br>
            Rains have started in the Kingdom, it is good time to be leaving.
