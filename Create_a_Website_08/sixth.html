        <p>I am sitting on my bed. I’m supposed to be sleeping. I’m supposed to be working tonight. I really, really do not want to go. But that is not what is keeping me awake, this time. My mind is speeding. It is nothing new, giving the fact that most of my life events happen only inside my mind. Over and over again. Trying to delete the things that I have said. The things that I have done. Trying to figure out the best approach to my future. To our future. The future for me and my family. I am actively trying to assure myself that the last 2 years have not done any damage to my girls and that they will grow up nice and balanced. But in the back of my mind I am petrified. What have I done?<br>
            <br>
            I am trying to find the positive, like I’ve been told repeatedly by different people lately. But it is difficult. Ok. The salary has been better than back home. The weather suits me. I do not understand people who complain of temperatures that reach +40 degrees and sometimes even higher. To me it feels perfect. Even I am covering myself from head to toe when I go outside my “home”, I can’t complain of the weather. Not here. Not once. Oh that was not true! I have complained! It was the time when the rains started and seemed never ending. (in reality it lasted maybe 2 and half weeks) But the sun and the heat – bring it on! Now winter is coming. Even here it feels cold, +20 to +30 in the daytime. Jacket wearing weather. So this is the positive. Not much really. This is what I have wasted 2 years of my life for, two years of my two little girl’s lives. It makes me sad every time I think of it. And it is every. single. day.<br>
            <br>
            Living in the most Arab country in the whole world has taught me to value high morals, high work ethics and high standards that I left back home. That is what I miss. I miss the easiness of processes. I miss the public transport. I miss clean, healthy food.<br>
            <br>
            Here it has been somewhat easy, giving the fact that I am most probably the only white moslem working in our hospital and for sure the only Finnish ICU nurse. It comes mostly with benefits; everyone will know me, even though I wouldn’t have any recollection of ever having met the person in question. It makes things easier when dealing with the locals. But the rest. OMG do they hate me for that or what? Soon alhamdulillah this is coming to an end. Less than 20 days to go and most of the paper work has already been done. I am so ready to leave this place. I don’t really mind the country, but the immigrants who come from far east have done their good share on making this place intolerable. And they are plenty.<br>
            <br>
            My near future is planned. I will fly to Egypt. To my Cairo. To my family. To my girls. December 4th couldn’t come faster. From here I will miss only one person. The hospital where I have been working – no. The colleagues – NO. The Finnish community – not really. Saudi – I don’t think so. Easy to leave and hopefully never to return without my family.<br>
