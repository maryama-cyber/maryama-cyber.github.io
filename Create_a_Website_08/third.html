        <p>I wasn't afraid. We would find a way to make it work. In a way I was excited of the new, but in the same time I was crying to leave my girls behind. It was supposed to be for only 4 months, tops. Little did I know. I wasn't even supposed to be the one to go work in the Middle East. It was his plan, from the beginning. He was supposed to leave first and we would follow. Fate would have it other way. I managed to get the job before him, so there went our original plan. Before we knew it, it was me who was packing up and saying good byes to my loved ones. Just 4 short months we promised to each other. We could do it!<br>
            <br>
            I arrived to the airport of Riyadh in the middle of the night. No internet connection, no phone line. My Arabic skills were not strong and the only Arabic I spoke was Egyptian Arabic – not exactly the same dialect. Only knowing that the agency had promised me accommodation in western compound and there I would meet up with other Finnish ladies. I had been told that someone would meet me up at the airport and would take care of the transportation and such.<br>
            <br>
            At the airport I was getting ready to go through immigration and to have my first pic taken. This would be the one that would be in my residency card, I had been told. So for sure I went in the ladies room beforehand to fix my appearance. I made my way to the immigration and stood in line for good 30 minutes. Picture was taken, passport stamped. Off you go, they said. Next I was waiting for my luggage, at least for another 30 minutes. Got my luggage finally and was going to stand in line for the customs, when out of nowhere this older lady comes to me and starts making all kinds of movements and gestures and talking Arabic, lots of Arabic! I had no idea what was going on – should I be calling for help or what. It turned out that had arrived to the most moslem country in the world with my abaya caught under my panties from the back. NO ONE bothered to tell me that before I was almost out form the airport. No one, except that older lady in the last line before outdoors. This was just the beginning of all the things that would not go as expected on my trip.<br>
            <br>
            After being back to decently dressed and through the customs I met the “meet and greet” –person from my future work place. He took me to the waiting area where I saw a large group of Asian looking people also waiting for the transportation. I was the only European arriving that day to the program. I did not feel the need to make friends then and there, so I stood alone with my luggage and waited. Last time I had eaten and drank was on the plane, but as I wasn’t told how long the waiting time was, I didn’t want to risk it and go buy food or drinks. The other reason was that I didn’t have any local cash with and I was hesitant to use my credit card in an Arab country where all the workers were Asians, not Arabs. It didn’t seem right to me.<br>
            <br>
            The microbus came and all of us, maybe 20 people and our luggage were packed in miraculously. The driver and his “skills” were not a shock for me having spent time in Cairo and the traffic was not even half as bad as I had expected. The distance was long and at the end of the trip I had a surprise waiting for me – I was not going to the European compound. No sir. The organizer, a man with poor English skills, did not understand when I was asking where I was being taken and why. So I just went with it, nothing else to do really. It was starting to be morning already and few of us were still waiting to be escorted to our housing. Still no water or snacks even. I was starving.<br>
            <br>
            Finally I was shown to a 2nd floor apartment and was given the keys to my room. I had been told by my agency that there would be a welcome package waiting for me in the room - some drinks and snacks and such, but NOTHING was waiting for me in the room. No water, no food. Still no internet, no way to charge my phone nor computer as the plugs were extremely different from back home. And for sure I hadn’t bought any equipment for that purpose because I was supposed to be going to the European compound, where some of the plugs would have been the same. The apartment was not even near to the pictures I had seen from the other compound. I was not happy.<br>
            <br>
            I was devastated. All the plans had been made based on what had been promised before I traveled. Promises that had zero truth behind them. Later I would learn that this was the way everything was handled in this place – people would just promise something to make others feel good, but there was no obligation to actually make the promises come true.<br>
            <br>
            I had made arrangements on getting the new phone line from a relative and he would be bringing it to me to the other compound along with some cash to get me started – but I wasn’t there! I had no way of telling him my location. My credit was limited on my home line and it was running out. I did not know where I was. My 2 villa mates were at work apparently, ‘cause I seemed to be alone in the villa. I had made plans on going shopping with the Finnish people I knew already from home, but as said, no way to contact anyone. I had arrived to a nightmare.<br>
            <br>
            Now I have been in My Cairo for a week. Stress levels are slowly coming down. I am loving every moment of this freedom I have. Even though the streets are crowded and traffic is maniac at times and the dust at the area where I live never seems to settle down, I still love it. I have unpacked my luggage. I have cleaned my home. I have settled. The nightmares are becoming less every night. The nightmares of work, of Saudi, of being apart from my loved ones. Soon I will pack my luggage once again as I am travelling after 3 days. This time I am taking my girls with me.
