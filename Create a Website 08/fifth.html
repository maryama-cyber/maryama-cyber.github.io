        <p>These are the words that everyone is excited to hear when they are having new relationship over the internet and they have never met face to face. Right? And especially even more so when they live half a world apart from each other.<br>
            <br>
            He stalked me over the Facebook for good half a year, I kept my suspicion alive but he kept his head. It was fast, the progress of our relationship, after I accepted his friend request. After a week or so we were engaged and within 2 months of our first conversation we got married. We knew we were meant to be together. Everything seemed to click. It felt like we had known each other forever. Only small insignificant issue was the distance between us: I lived in Finland, he lived in Egypt. The expenses of our relationship got a bit high – even though internet was fairly cheap, calling was not and after couple of 1000e phone bills we had to make decisions. This is when he suggested that he would apply for a visa to come to me and we could live in Finland for the time being. He was in between jobs and I had my permanent job with steady salary, so it was a no brainer. I closed my eyes, hoped for the best and sent him the money. Knowing that this could end either way – he would just take the money and I would never hear from him again OR he would be trustworthy and do as we had planned.<br>
            <br>
            It wasn’t too easy for us though. His first visa application got rejected. After the news, I booked myself into a plane that very same week; being Finnish it was easier for me, no need to apply for a visa before travelling. I arrived to Cairo on Valentine’s Day – what could be more appropriate and romantic than meeting the love of your life for the first time face to face on Valentine’s? There was no disappointment, no “catfish” waiting for me in the airport! And no “catfish” for him either! I had planned to stay for 3 weeks in Cairo that first time and already had planned that if he did turn out to be someone else he had told me he was, I would just go on and have a great vacation in a city I always had dreamed on going to. Luckily there was no need to use my backup plan!<br>
            <br>
            We had to see a lawyer many times before our wedding and had to wait in long lines for long hours to get documentations for whatever the reasons. Some of which we never even received in the end - one was the certificate from my country saying that we are allowed to marry each other; until today it has never reached us and it has soon been 9 years. Our wedding was simple and no reception after the contract was signed. I joked around that maybe the contract said something about trading me for camels as it was all written in Arabic and until now I can’t really read it. But for all these years, no camels has been around, even though I can guarantee that he has been planning on trading me into anything with a heartbeat for more than once over our time together!<br>
            <br>
            After we got married we lived apart for 7 months; all this time the government was processing his application to get license to live in Finland. During that time I went to visit him twice in Egypt. Luckily travelling was quite easy for me; I got the time off from my work and had the money to go, even managed to arrange for a dog sitter with fair price.<br>
            <br>
            Finally he got accepted and got the entry visa. He arrived to Finland on a sunny but cool fall day. Everything was new and different for him from what he had known all his life. But he came anyway, knowing only me in this new, weird, cold country. For sure the culture shock for him was something I can never fully understand, but he took it well. Over the years he actually became more Finnish than I would prefer and when the time came for him to go back to Egypt, he experienced the culture shock again! He was complaining to me more than once how Egyptians were driving him crazy with their reckless driving style or how they just left garbage laying around on the ground or how they liked to make everything so difficult. All these things didn't bother him before, but now he was noticing them differently. It was funny for me, how he was missing things from Finland, the things even that he was not so fond of while living there.<br>
            <br>
            I have 2 weeks left in Saudi now and I have not prepared my head for the culture shock. Until now the longest stay I have had in Egypt, has been 2 months. I do like the atmosphere there, I don’t mind the traffic, food is cheaper than in Finland.. I don’t know really what to expect. I’m letting the country show me what it has to offer for me. I will stress about it later. The most important part is that I will be with my family again! The rest I can adjust to. Life is all about the decisions You make!<br>
