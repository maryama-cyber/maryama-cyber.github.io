        <p>We were supposed to be separated only for 3-4 months. He would come with the girls as soon as the orientation and preceptorship periods would finish. As soon as my residence card would be valid and I could invite them to come. During their stay, he would actively search for work - it would be easier once inside the country, we were told. He would start working and we would go back to normal life.<br>
            <br>
            After 5 months of waiting they arrived. The hospital had agreed to let us stay in one of the visitor villas inside the compound for free, but only for limited time. Their visit visa would be valid for 3 months visit, but accommodation only for 1 and half months. That was a small issue to fix, not a big deal we thought. He would find work and it would all go smoothly.<br>
            <br>
            Days and weeks passed and he did find interested employers, but every time the same issue kept coming up - no residence permit. It seemed to be very big issue and none of the employers were willing to proceed with the process of applying one for him - unless he would agree to sign his contract as Egyptian instead of Finnish. This would mean lower salary and benefit package. He did not agree on the terms and kept on searching. It seemed to be a dead end and a new plan needed to be made. The time of free accommodation was coming to an end. He had to go visit Kuwait. We were stuck. No babysitter for the girls while he would be in Kuwait and I would be working. All signs were pointing to Egypt.<br>
            <br>
            No matter how we were looking at the picture, the only way out was for him to take our girls to his mother in Cairo before his trip to Kuwait. And after that they wouldn't be able to come back to me. Visa was only for single entry and exit. Our dream was crushed. We had to do what was the most reasonable thing to do at the moment: go to Egypt. And this is what he did. It would be shorter distance for me to go visit them there than Finland and cheaper for sure. Change of plans. Once again.<br>
            <br>
            Tables have turned yet again. I am stuck in Finland. My girls are back in Egypt with their father and I am as far from my stress free life as can be. Luckily I have the best nurse manager and nursing supervisor here and they agreed for me to work in my old unit as long as I need.<br>
            <br>
            I am back in the situation where I’m concentrating on breathing only – breathe in and out, do not count hours, try to focus on the future, this is nothing but a passing phase. If God is willing, it will get easier by the day. I do not like to live here. Even my apartment is feeling strange now that I’m here alone. My home is not here anymore.
